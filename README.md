# The Warlock of Firetop Mountain
The original ‘Warlock of Firetop Mountain’ was first published in 1982 as a single-player adventure game book written by Steve Jackson and Ian Livingstone and illustrated by Russ Nicholson.

The game book inspired two direct sequels and five novels as well as being adapted into a board and video game. The original game book distinguished itself by featuring a fantasy role-playing element where the reader becomes the hero.

The ‘Warlock of Firetop Mountain’ is a fantasy scenario involving a dungeon quest during which the reader searches for the “untold wealth of treasure" hidden and guarded by the powerful, elementalist warlock 'Zagor'. As the adventurer, the player explores the cavernous dungeons beneath Firetop Mountain. At the start of the quest, the player is told by the inhabitants of a nearby village that the treasure is stored in a chest secured with two locks and that the keys are guarded by various creatures. The hero must navigate the dungeons beneath Firetop Mountain, battle monsters, locate the keys, unlock the treasure chest and escape.

## Role Playing Games (RPGs)
In general, most of the games within the genre of ‘Role Playing’ are loosely based on the terminology and mechanics of table-top games such as Dungeons & Dragons.  Although these games typically focus on the statistical development of a character over time, they also support interactive storytelling and collaboration with other players or through interaction with NPCs (non-playing characters).

Through interaction with non-playing characters, role playing video games typically allow players to create and experience a fictional world (e.g. sci-fi, fantasy, war, etc.). Player motivation is created through an immersive story during which the environment can be explored and artefacts can be collected, fashioned, used or sold; this is typically provided in the form of quests with rewards for taking action, solving puzzles or completing challenges.  In many instances the story’s narrative is also supported with simple, detailed or animated visual representations (game art) of the environment together with the creatures or inhabitants that populate it, as well as atmospheric music, sound effects and engaging, non-linear dialogue.

Player characters are generally controlled and developed through a process of structured decision-making and character development systems.  The success or failure of actions taken within the game is generally dependent on pseudo-random dice rolls combined with a formal set of rules and guides; the focus of which is to typically emphasize the statistical development of the player’s character over time or through the interactive story, player collaboration or interaction with NPCs.

## Designing a Narrative RPG 
The Narrative RPG is a subtype of the RPG genre. In this genre, the player is driven almost completely by the narration; as such they need (and should want to) enjoy the story, the setting, the Non-Playing Character (NPC) engagements and the development of their own character.  Although it is important that the player can evolve their character during the game it is even more important that the player themselves engage and believe in the overall narrative. This means that most of the design, development and production effort should be focused on the functions and features that support this.  This approach is especially true for the ‘Critical Path’; meaning the main quest, campaign, or challenge, etc. that will focus the player and drive them to want to finish the game.

In a Narrative RPG, immersion is critical; everything from combat to navigation, level design, and art direction - always keep one word in mind: Immersion.


## Rules, Features and Functions for Narrative RPGs:
Although not extensive the following points should be considered when designing and developing a narrative RPG.

- Fully formed three dimensional characters; players should feel like all the Non-Playing Characters (NPCs) have stories to tell and are unique in some way (in simple terms this could merely be that they talk in a strange accent or that they have a distinctive scar on their face, etc.).

- Every location should tell or reinforce the story; this should be a strong focus for level or world design. Consider questions like: Why are these monsters here? Why is this object shaped to look like this?  What is its purpose? What is special about this place? As the designer or developer, you must always be challenging yourself with questions; in many cases, you don’t always need to give answers to the player, simply defining the reasons for yourself will help create immersion.

- Itemisation can help establish and reinforce immersion; all items should include at least a simple description and backstory. Consider questions like: Why does that creature drop that sword? Where does this item come from? What purpose does it serve? How can it be used to reward or challenge the player?  Does it branch the narrative?

- Combat mechanics (including powers) must ‘feel’ coherent with the game world.  Ideally, dialogues and cut-scenes should make use of some of the character's powers (e.g. show the player’s character healing a wounded NPC).  Almost every aspect of the game should feel like it evolves narratively (e.g. the main character, sidekick characters (if any), the areas and locations the player travels through, items and backstories, as well as any secondary characters and yes - even the ‘bad guys’.

- Your game dialog must support multiple branches and allow for different answers or outcomes; avoid extensive or heavy ‘linear’ dialog and allow the player the opportunity to define their character’s personality and morality. However, this may not always be appropriate especially if the RPG is based on a predefined character (e.g. The Witcher, etc.), in situations such as this – your goal should be to create a portrayal of that character and let the player empathise and engage with it.  Although this approach may appear limited because the player must stay within the character’s original profile it does reduce the need to design and develop extremely contrasted personality or morality choices – and - it can, if done well, be extremely rewarding for the player.

## Game Programming and Assets Creation
As game programming is an essential part of the overall game development process, programmers, in addition to needing to be creative and excellent problem-solvers also need to be good communicators, be able to take instructions and have excellent skills with regards to selecting and using suitable languages (e.g. Assembly, C, C++, C#, Objective-C, Java, VB.Net, Lua, Python, JavaScript, ECMAScript, Swift, Rust or Tcl, etc.).  In addition, developers also need to be highly organised, systematic, innovative, able to work independently or as part of a team to meet deadlines.  Other advantages would include experience with specific platforms as well as a good understanding of game-play.

As game programmers design and write the code that runs the game - they are critical to the success of the game development process.  Since different platforms (e.g. consoles, PCs, mobiles, etc.) often have different programming requirements programmers often use or adapt ready-made libraries, frameworks or engines (e.g. audio & graphic management, collision detection, 2D or 3D game physics, database services and ad or monetised management services) to help reduce development time and improve cross-platform compatibility, etc.  Due to the variety of specialisms within game development and to increase a project’s overall success, programmers can specialise in physics programming, AI (artificial intelligence), 3D engine development or interface and control systems.  In addition, programmers developing a multiplayer game should also be proficient in areas such as network and database programming. 


### Asset Creation
Every aspect of every video game must be designed and implemented; as a result, almost every game is a complex collection of stories, music, sound effects and art – and that doesn’t even come close to covering everything else! 

Developing the visual assets for a game represents a significant investment in both time and effort (a.k.a. ‘a really big job’); in fact, it is generally safe to say that asset creation likely represents the most significant cost of game development (even when compared to aspects like design, development, testing, deployment and marketing). 

Although games can differ in size, type and complexity there is (generally) a standard set of needed assets.  When planning these assets the following elements should be considered and where appropriate created – failure to create a ‘cohesive’ package with regards to the ‘look’ and ‘feel’ of your game will significantly impact player immersion into your game world.

Due to advancements in game creation, depth, use and player engagement (specially over the last decade or so) - it is worth noting that by today’s standards (and more importantly - player expectation) that historically impressive looking game art can, and is often now considered crudely simplistic or even ridiculously inadequate.

As styles and themes for game art can vary dramatically – art type can be classified in different ways; this could include rendering style (2D, 3D, Cel Shaded, Realistic, etc.) or player perspective (Isometric, First-Person, Side-Scrolling, etc.) or even artistic style (Cartoon, Comic-Book, Manga, Impressionist, etc.).  However, in the paper published by Lee, J. H., Perti, A., Cho, H., et al. (2014) the following terms for game art were clearly defined: Abstract, Cel-shaded, Comic book (Anime/Manga), Handicraft, Lego, Map-based, Pixel art, Realistic, Silhouette, Stylized, Text, Watercolor or Other.  They went on to describe and define possible variations of colour as: Achromatic or Colorful – and – variations in light as being either: Bright or Dark.  When discussing or developing your game’s art it is worth researching all the various types before finally deciding and implementing the preferred style.

Although the elements below represent a reasonable outline of different types of game art - depending on the type of game you are developing (or considering) there can be many more.  To improve your skills, after reviewing the details below take time to study the different types of assets in your favourite games, take note of the various qualities and makeup of key assets (in many cases you can see those the artist or developer focused on). It should not be surprising that by updating, changing, or refining your assets you can dramatically improve the entire look, feel and even success of your game.


### Level Design
‘Level Design’ is an important part of the game development process and despite appearing (in some ways) to overlap it should not be confused with ‘Environmental Design’. ‘Level Design’ is essentially the meeting of ‘art’ with ‘gameplay’.  A level designer or artist works with other artists to determine where the in game assets should be placed (in relation to the overall game environment and world) as well as ensuring that the game’s physics engine, mechanics or gameplay are not compromised.  ‘Level Design’ is also used to help safeguard, drive and motivate player engagement and immersion using ‘appropriate’ challenge and/or reward systems based on certain in-game actions or engagements, etc.  In the early days of video games, Level Design was generally simple (e.g. PacMan’s maze). However, today, it is often considered a substantial job within the game development process as - and - for the purposes of your game, should be well considered.


### Environmental Art
Well designed 'Environmental Art' can be used to significantly improve in-game experience and increase player immersion.  As game trends develop over time, simple, static or plain environments have been replaced with a more sophisticated and dynamic gamescape that can often reinforce or extend the game itself.  Games that incorporate or use organically changing environments (e.g. Halo, Call of Duty, Warcraft, Minecraft, etc.) can notably add to the player’s feeling of being literally ‘in’ the game.

### Characters Art
Although ‘Character Art’ is an important element of game design, to be successful - game characters do not always have to be meticulously or painstakingly created; even simple characters like ‘Homer Simpson’ or ‘Super Mario Brothers’ can be memorable or engaging. However, even though these characters may appear or look simple their development is typically the result of many hours of refined work and consideration.

Designing a new character for your game can quickly become an ever-increasing challenge.  However, in addition to ensuring that your assets (including props, objects, etc.) always fit the environment and game world - try to experiment and focus on the following key areas: design for your game audience, plan for the hardware (mobile, HD, etc.), consider the environment then research & deconstruct other successful character designs, make your character distinctive, adopt appropriate lines, styles and qualities to reinforce your character’s description (e.g. line thickness can be used to help represent strength, frailty etc.), use exaggerated characteristics, carefully consider colour, accessorise or augment your character, consider whether 2D or 3D is more appropriate, provide a personality (this can be supported by animation, narrative, etc.), provide strong facial expressions, consider the character’s aims and objectives, build a good back story and don’t limit yourself by just using a mouse or Photoshop, etc. - be flexible – start with pen & paper and finally get (and use) all the feedback you can. 

If you’re considering designing or developing 3D objects investigate and research polygon count.  Generally, the higher the polygon count the more defined and detailed the asset can be; however, the higher the count - the more complicated and detailed the work needs to be.


### Prop Design
‘Props’ represent all the non-living objects embedded in the game world that can help expand or heighten a player’s experience and gameplay (e.g. barrels, furniture or tools that can be used or moved.  Other objects could include flags, levers or switches that can be touched or traded to create or respond to events.  In addition, ‘Props’ can also be used as barriers to limit or prevent movement beyond a specific point). When designing games ‘Props’ should be considered important and not be overlooked.


### Destructible Objects
'Destructible objects' generally represent a critical element in most games – typically they are items that can help drive action or create player motivation; these items can often influence or effect the balance of power at a character or game level.  While some objects can cause damage, others can only be destroyed via other objects.  Simple examples of this can be seen in retro games like ‘Donkey Kong’ – during which, barrels hit with a hammer explode and react with other objects. Although many new games are considerably more complex the mechanics are essentially the same (although, perhaps with more polygons and slightly better physics).


### Vehicles
Early use of ‘Vehicles’ was generally limited to simple racing or flying games during which players were able to swerve back and forth to avoid oncoming objects.  However, this often left players with a somewhat limited sense of engagement.  By contrast, today’s games tend to be significantly more immersive as developers have (through experience as well as technical improvements) figured out how to make vehicles drive or move in a more realistic manner.  Consider games like Gran Turismo in which acceleration, breaking, inertia, etc. appear to follow the basic rules of physics.  When designing your game consider how and when to best utilise this sophisticated aspect of play.  


### Weapons
Although, more predominant in shooting style games, ‘Weapons’ (e.g. realistic, sci-fi, fantasy, etc.) are typically an intrinsic part of the mechanics and narrative of most video games.  However, as technology, game design and player expectation changes it is important to recognise that weapons should (in addition to being well considered with regards to the in-game combat systems) be well designed visually.  When designing any weapon always consider the following order: spec and requirement, research real weapons, design from all angles, start with a simple silhouette (e.g. greyscale, no shading – just light, mid and dark tones), develop a theme, composition (try to avoid repeating shapes – this can be boring – consider design principles such as ‘rule of thirds’), establish a flow to your design, use canvas flipping, add colour and enhanced composition, add fine details, add general textures, highlight key areas using a lens flare texture, add logos and decals, add shade to enhance volume and finally (if necessary) build blueprints to aid 3D modelling.



## Game Mechanics
Like all Role-Playing-Games (RPGs), this Fighting Fantasy game will use ‘dice’ as a principal component of the game. In addition to initially defining the player’s characteristics (such as: **SKILL**, **STAMINA** and **LUCK**), the values rolled during the game are used to determine the outcome of events and dictate probability.  To play this Fighting Fantasy game, the player will access multiple six-sided dice and follow the basic game rules: 
- Roll multiple six-sided and compare the total value to the appropriate characteristic (**SKILL**, **STAMINA** and **LUCK**)
- If the total rolled value EQUALS or is LESS THAN the characteristic’s current value, then the action succeeds.

The core game mechanics use a system of three characteristics known as **SKILL**, **STAMINA** and **LUCK**. These three characteristics describe the aspects of the player’s character. Each characteristic is represented as a numeric value and defines the natural talent of the adventurer (values are generated by the roll of two six-sided dice: 2D6). The values will affect the player’s character during play as well as how they interact with the other inhabitants of the game world.  


### Overall Objective 
Create an adventurer and use it to navigate the cavernous dungeons, defeat the creatures, obtain the keys to the treasure chest, find and surreptitiously take the Warlock’s treasure before escaping the mountain.


### Characteristics  
#### SKILL:
In addition to describing the character’s expertise as a fighter this attribute also represents the character’s strength, physical prowess, intelligence (e.g. logic, intuitiveness and mental agility), initiative (e.g. speed of thought), dexterity (e.g. ability to perform complex or intricate tasks), as well as other activities such as: striking and parrying, balancing, lock-picking, pick-pocketing and sneaking. Wider talents associated with this attribute include persuasion (e.g. charisma and how easily your character can influence, lead, manipulate, or generally get on with others), physical senses (i.e. sharpness of your character’s five or six senses such as the ability to notice things, searching or tracking).

Although a player’s character’s SKILL is typically between 7 to 12 - other creatures or characters encountered may have more, or less than this! Any actions that depend upon how skilful the adventurer is at sneaking about without being heard, climbing up a steep wall, dodging an arrow, or jumping a large pit can usually be decided by testing the probability of success. This can be decided by rolling against the adventurer’s SKILL (a roll less than or equal to the adventurers current SKILL typically means success while an exceeding score generally means failure).


#### STAMINA:
In addition to measuring the health of the adventurer this attribute also represents fitness, the character’s will to survive and their general constitution (e.g. ability to resist damage, etc.). Adventurers usually have a STAMINA score between 14 to 24; however other creatures or characters they encounter may have more or less than this. During the adventure, injury and exhaustion reduce the adventurer’s STAMINA. However, this can be replenished by rest or sleep, eating provisions (food), drinking potions or by the application of healing magic. 

In general, characters with high STAMINA are more likely succeed at actions than if their STAMINA was very low. However, if the adventurer’s STAMINA is reduced to zero they are most likely dead!  


#### LUCK:
This measurement represents the adventurer’s good fortune, success, fate, destiny, etc.  It also describes their ability to possibly receive divine intervention during the adventure. In addition, it also represents their chance to avoid or force an encounter or event as well as their ability to favourably influence the outcome, it may even help you sneak past sleeping guards or affect the quality of found items and in some situations, it may even save your character from death. Adventurer’s LUCK usually sits in the range of 7 to 12; however, in contrast non-playing creatures and characters (NPCs) do not use LUCK.

Any action that depends on luck (e.g. avoiding damage from rock slides, falls, etc.) can be decided by rolling against the adventurer’s LUCK (a roll equal or greater than the player’s current LUCK means success, however, a lower score means failure). This action is known as **‘Testing Luck’** - players should appreciate that relying on LUCK becomes a risky business as it is drained by at least 1 point each time it is used; meaning the more it is used the dicier it becomes.

Once a player’s character depletes their STAMINA and is not able to restore themselves they are considered ‘expired’ or ‘dead’.  ‘Expired’ or ‘dead’ characters lose all GOLD, EXPERIENCE POINTS, INVENTORY, ARMOUR and WEAPONS.  However, the player is given the opportunity to restart and play the game again from the beginning

# Project Management and Development Strategy 
Game development is generally a complex, involved and multidiscipline task.  In industry, it is supported by many people in many teams.  As a process, it generally follows the stages of: concept, pre-production, production and post-production (although software testing should be integral with the various stages - for the purpose of this document it has been given its own section).  As a result, and to help manage these composite processes, organisations recognise the need to implement efficient development and management strategies.


## Agile Development Cycle
Unlike the more traditional development cycles that focus extensively on a project’s initial analysis and design.  Agile uses iterations (or phases) to create multiple development loops – each loop tries to adopt an optimal balance between the time taken to design, develop and deliver working software. 

The optimal outcome for Agile is to scope the project as a set of connected but generally discrete features (this could include systems or services, etc.).  Once the scope is defined the programmers’ complete multiple iterations covering all required features (including analysis, design, development and testing).  At the end of each iteration (a short or fixed time box defined by the team, e.g. between 1 – 4 weeks) the specific features developed in that iteration are released.


## Agile Software Development & Scrum Methodology
Scrum is an iterative and incremental agile software development strategy for managing software projects; its approach represents a significant departure from earlier methodologies due to the well observed and intrinsic shortcomings inherent with strategies such as waterfall, etc. 
Scrum emphasises collaboration, functioning software, team self-management and flexibility to adapt to emerging requirements.  

### Agile and Scrum
To help successfully structure, plan, monitor and deliver a viable software development solution organisations generally require and adopt a robust management framework. Unfortunately, as the name suggests ‘Agile’ does not explicitly offer concrete steps - as such organisations usually seek more specific methods within the Agile movement.  Although there are several reasonable options (e.g. Crystal Clear, Extreme Programming, Feature Driven or Dynamic Systems Development Methods, etc.) – Scrum’s philosophy offers an efficient and effective approach.  Scrum’s use of simple definitions means that teams can gain more operational autonomy while also helping improve responsibility, management and communication; these easily implemented aspects can help ensure the project’s overall success as well as providing more accurate delivery dates.

Although arguably not a methodology, overall the ‘Agile’ approach attempts to provide alternatives to the more traditionally ridgid, sequential project management strategies (e.g. Waterfall, etc.). To achieve this, ‘Agile’ uses incremental and iterative cycles supported with empirical, experiential, observed or practical feedback to help teams respond to the potentially unpredictable and changeable nature of project aspects (e.g. requirements, project direction, features as well as bugs and issues etc.).  Unlike ‘Waterfall’ in which teams generally only have one chance to get all aspects of a project right - the ‘Agile’ methodology attempts to deliver potentially shippable product increments through regular phases of work, known as sprints or iterations.  These ‘sprints’ are used to regularly provide opportunities to consider, review, redesign and steer the direction of every aspect of the project throughout its entire development lifecycle.  


### Game Development
Game development should generally begin with a concept design; this can be an existing, unique or original idea, it could also be the result of experimenting with different features, styles or techniques etc.  As part of the early pre-production stage and before the main design documents are fully complete - programmers are often expected to provide working prototypes to help demonstrate, explore and better define and determine the gameplay ideas. 

Prototypes (although not expected to be without issues), are generally developed quickly and without too much consideration for extended up-front design. Once created they are typically used to help test and try out new ideas and features or act as a proof of concept.

Although the programmer's main job is not to develop the game’s concept, much like artists, they do contribute to the game’s overall design.  Once the development cycle starts in earnest, the game’s designer will create and update the game’s design document – as part of this they will generally work closely, discuss ideas, review issues and agree strategies with producers as well as both lead artists and programmers; it is also not uncommon that non-lead members will also contribute.  As the project progresses, programmers should follow the game’s design document and be aware that it will likely be regularly updated to reflect newly identified limitations or exploit ideas, capabilities or features.




### Concept
Regardless of where it comes from – all games start with a basic idea; ideas may be completely original or adapted from an existing game or even from licenced copyright (e.g. Star Wars, etc.). However, once the principle idea for the game has been determined and unravelled - a brief concept document should be prepared (usually) by the original designer. Once the document has been completed (supported with a preliminary plan for the project) the whole thing needs ‘green lighting’ by the decision makers; in most cases, decision makers consist of stakeholders such as publishers, manufacturers, licence holders, etc. In addition to creating a concept document, designers can also be asked to provide a ‘vertical slice’; this is a playable portion of the game (e.g. a partial level, single scene, etc.).  The purpose of a vertical slice is to provide a proof of concept for stakeholders before they agree to fund the rest. A vertical slice is not an early prototype - it is a playable demo that is expected to look and act like the final game (in quality and play); consider being asked to sample of a piece of cake before agreeing to pay for the entire cake.  Generally, requests for a vertical slice can indicate positive intentions from your stakeholders or demonstrate that they have no clear understanding about your game or its mechanics.  Despite being potentially only 10% of the entire game - creating a vertical slice can often represent 60-70% of the entire game; it is typically a huge investment in time and effort. 



### Pre-production
Once given the ‘green light’, a more detailed design document needs to be produced, again, this is typically created by the original designer; it is important to recognise that the purpose of any game document is to record and communicate ideas (e.g. principles, game mechanics, hardware platform and visual styles, etc.).  Designers or developers should not work in isolation; rather, they should communicate their ideas and work closely with others (e.g. designers, programmers, sound engineers, specialist artists, level designers, etc.).  To successfully design, develop and release a professional game - it is vital to review and agree whether the overall project is realistic and achievable. Once agreed, and the detailed design document is produced, the programmers should produce a technical document; this document outlines the game’s engine, technical schematics and the use of technology needed in the game.  To support the project, a conceptual artist may also draft material to help create a more concrete perception of the game's look and feel. Project managers and producers will then develop and document plans and schedules for the project’s milestones and deliverables. These documents help give focus and give the game direction and once completed the game can go into production.

### Production
Once in production, game development can be generally divided into the areas of: programming, art, music and management.  Programming plays an enormous part in making games and normally requires many people working on the various elements (e.g. game’s engine, tools, artificial intelligence, user interface, etc.). However, in some circumstances programmers can work across teams or projects and in all departments.  Artists and animators are used to create all the visuals for the game world, including characters, objects, backgrounds, textures, animations, cut-scenes and interface design.  Musicians are generally used to create the game’s audio tracks; this includes ambient or background music as well as surround sound and special effects. In addition, the studio’s sound department will also handle the production of voice-overs and recorded dialogues.  

Whilst programming, music and graphics are being created - game producers and project managers will oversee the game’s overall production and delivery by scheduling work, managing risk and in general ensuring the project is on track via meeting agreed milestones and making sure good progress is being made.  In commercial environments, game development projects are often expected to meet publisher set milestones; these milestones are used to track key events and ensure the project will be delivered on time.  Although milestones can vary from publisher to publisher typical events can be defined as the following stages: ‘first playable’, ‘alpha’, beta’, ‘release candidate’ and ‘gold master’.  

First playable (or pre-alpha) generally refers to a more developed version of the concept prototype and is used to demonstrate play, basic mechanics, etc. as well as showing the basic assets. Alpha, generally referrers to the stage when the key gameplay, features and functionality is complete together with ‘mostly’ finished game assets; this allows testing to begin (in earnest) as the game is playable and contains all its major features (feedback is used from testing to identify and fix bugs while allowing further refinement and development to be made to improve gameplay).  Beta, generally means that features and assets are fully complete and that only minor bugs should remain; publishers assume that games in ‘beta’ are generally ready to be shipped (in that all issues that would cause the game to be rejected by console manufacturers or online stores (e.g. Google Play, Apple’s App Store, Xbox Game Store, Steam, etc.) have now been fully addressed) -– no features, assets or code changes are made in this stage. Release candidates are usually created once all the serious bugs during ‘beta’ have been reported; this stage is considered ‘nearly’ stable and is normally tested against a Quality Assurance ‘QA’ test plan. QA acts as a double, or even triple check process during which the game is checked by several testers to ensure that all possible bugs are identified and resolved.  ‘Gold master’ indicates that the game is in its final build and is ready to be used as a master for production.


### Post-production:
Once in Post, a Quality Assurance (QA) test plan is used to carry out repetitive and extensive checks on the game by multiple testers.  Each tester will play through the entire game (over and over) to identify, document and check-off bugs using a dedicated database system until they are fixed.

In addition, the graphic artists will polish the game’s final look while the developers tweak the gameplay until it is ‘perfect’.  After the final game is complete, it is submitted to console manufacturer stores for final and external testing – once accepted, the marketing can begin and a master disc is created, duplicated and sent to stores and warehouses as well as being released via online stores.

If the game is to be translated into multiple languages, it is usually done after the English language copy is released. Audio and/or subtitles are added, duplicated and shipped to the target countries.


### Software Testing
Software testing is one of the most time consuming and resource hungry activities within the development cycle - as a games developer, you need to try to avoid the many pitfalls and perils inherent in the creation of complex game. Some developers consider testing to be a necessary evil or a secondary concern; in short, it is often or only used as a short process to find glaring or immediate errors.

It is a common misconception to think that there is a single ‘best’ method for game testing or that one method is better than another.  However, it should be recognised that successful games testing is both a science and an art and that regardless of how extensive your testing strategy is, a single approach (such as: following a strict set of conditions or performing seemingly random tests) is simply not enough. Developers need to use both art and science to identify and fix as many bugs as possible.

‘Ad-hoc’ or ‘free testing’ typically represents one of the more common forms used to test games and generally falls on the artistic side; this approach is generally fluid and can seem a little random as it focuses on broad, non-specific tasks. In contrast, the adoption of a scientific approach generally means implementing a ‘test case’ strategy. This method follows a produced list of specific tests that are typically based on the services and functions embedded in the game and how they interact with each other, etc. Test cases are a counterpoint to ad-hoc testing; where ad-hoc testing seems random, test cases are strict and disciplined. Test cases should be designed to systematically confirm the full operation of a function or feature regardless of whether this is as simple as moving within an environment or as complex as casting an intricate spell at a group of enemies.


### White-Box Testing and Black-Box Testing
White- and Black-box testing generally forms the backbone of all testing strategies. The difference is largely dependent on the amount of information known (or available) to the tester about the underlying working of the software.

Black-box testing relates to when the tester has little or no information about the internal workings of the game; the tester essentially takes on the role of the ‘end-user’, seeing what they would see and acting in the way they would act (e.g. playing a beta build of a game on a test console).

White-box testing, is more systematic in nature and requires testers to have considerable knowledge, use or access to the games internal functions (either directly or via a debugger).  Their task is to identify and track bugs within the internal processes and mechanisms of the game as the system runs; results are relayed back to the tester or a test log.
